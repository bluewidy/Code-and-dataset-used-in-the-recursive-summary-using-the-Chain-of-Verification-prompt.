Educated by Tara Westover is a memoir about a woman who escapes her strict upbringing to pursue education. Which I found fascinating. Another one if my favorites, however , in the psychology department is called Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman it is a mind-bending exploration of the two systems that drive the way we think."

17. Emily enjoys non‑fiction tech books such as "The Shallows" and "Thinking, Fast and Slow," and is also interested in investing in abstract expressionist art.

19. Kate recently cooked a ham and peas pasta dish during a cooking class.
20. Emily attended Art Basel in Miami and plans to visit more art exhibitions to learn about the market.

We need to ensure no duplicates. We already have sentence 15 summarizing both enjoy social activities. But we can keep that. We need to keep <=20. We have 15 + 5 = 20. Good.

Check for redundancy: Sentence 15 already says both enjoy social activities, exploring new places, sharing experiences. That's fine.

User: "Hey Emily! Thanks for the New Year's wishes! I had a cozy celebration with close friends and family. We had a delicious dinner, played some games, and watched the fireworks at midnight. How about you?"
Assistant: "That sounds like a great way to celebrate the New Year. I decided to go have a dinner with family out in Miami where we got to watch the fireworks at midnight and have a lovely japenese dinner. After the fireworks we started off the New Year with dessert and drinks!"
User: "I'm glad you got to spend it with your family. What kind of desserts and drinks did you enjoy to kick off the New Year? Anything particularly special or unique?"
Assistant: "We had a variety of desserts including some special Japenese ones like Dragon’s Egg, and Mochi. Then a bunch of classics like cheesecake, tiramisu, eclairs, and ice cream. We had a couple lovely drinks that the bar at the restaurant made for us!"
User: "Wow, that sounds absolutely delicious! I am a big fan of desserts. Feel free to share any pictures, I would love to see them!"
Assistant: "Here are some of the desserts from last night. What’s your favorite dessert Kate? What did you have for New Years Eve?"
User: "This New Years Eve I enjoyed some delicious Tiramisu, that I learned to make in my Italian cooking class. It also happens to be my all time favorite dessert!"
User: "Here let me show you"
Assistant: "Wow Kate, that looks amazing. Was it hard to make? How did you make it? It looks incredible really!"
Assistant: "Here’s a photo of the amazing New Years fireworks here in Miami. You definitely have to spend New Years atleast once in Miami it’s amazing. The nightlife is also one not to miss!"
User: "Making Tiramisu was a delightful experience! I followed a traditional recipe using ladyfinger biscuits dipped in espresso and layered them with a creamy mixture of mascarpone, eggs, sugar, and a hint of cocoa powder. It really is simple to make it just needs a bit of patience!"
User: "That looks spectacular!"
User: "I really want to visit Miami for the New Years, maybe next year we can organzie something together?"
Assistant: "Wow making a tiramisu sounds easier than I thought. Maybe I should give it a try one day. How did yours turn out? Are you going to make it again?"
Assistant: "Yes definitely next year we should plan New Years in Miami. There is so much to do and we can have such a fun night. It is for sure worth the experience to celebrate New Years in Miami at least once!"
User: "Absolutely, you should definitely give it a try! My Tiramisu turned out wonderfully it was rich, creamy, and with the perfect balance of coffee and sweetness. I'm planning to make it again, especially since it was a hit with friends and family."
User: "Have you celebrated New Year's anywhere else apart from Miami?"
Assistant: "I’m gonna try to make it this weekend. I made a cheesecake last week and it turned out a success, things that tend to not need to be baked in the over usually work out the best for me! I sometimes forget them in the oven and end up burning them so a tiramisu sounds like a great idea for this weekend!"
Assistant: "Yes, I’ve celebrated New Years before in the Caribbean, Los Angeles, New York, Boston, and Europe! What about you? What is your favorite New Years location?"
User: "Wow, that's quite a list! I've been to various places, but my favorite New Year's celebration has to be in New York. The energy in Times Square and the iconic ball drop make it an unforgettable experience for me."
Assistant: "That is quite the experience. I have celebrated New Years in New York once and the ball drop was my favorite moment and I always think about it every year!"
User: "This was it last night!"
Assistant: "Wow that looks amazing Kate. I was wondering what it looked like last night thank you for sharing that with me!"

Assistant: "I actually have not been. I will take note of it so that I can visit them the next time I am in San Diego!"
User: "I highly recommend it!"
User: "Are there any other places or expiences you've enjoyed in San Diego or Las Vegas?"
Assistant: "One of the best acitivities is going to the Grand Canyon. A lot of people choose to go via helicopter from Last Vegas. The view is amazing and the experience is one of a kind. The ride is short and not too long but you get the most amazing views that you could think of. Many people choose to go by driving it’s a bit longer but still you get to spend more time there and go on a hike around the park as well. The journey is so much fun and the Grand Canyon is definitely not a place to miss! Have you ever visited the Grand Canyon. If so, what are your thoughts on it?"
User: "Oh, absolutely! I've been to the Grand Canyon, and it's truly a breathtaking experience. I did the helicopter tour from Las Vegas, and you're spot on about the incredible views, it's like seeing a whole other world from up there. The short ride is packed with beautiful scenery. I've also done the drive, and while it takes a bit longer, the journey is part of the fun. There's something special about exploring the Grand Canyon at your own pace, taking in the sights and even going for a hike. The vastness, unique rock formations, and the play of colors can leave a lasting impression. It's a place that leaves a lasting impression."
Assistant: "The Grand Canyon is probably on most people's bucket list, I always really take the time to really appreciate it. Seeing the vast landscape in reality can be a challenge to get the perspective - it really just looks like a picture. Then, after a few minutes you appreciate just how huge it is, and what you're experiencing... it's beautiful, awesome and something never to forget."
User: "This is the picture I took during the helicopter ride"
Assistant: "Stunning photo of the Grand Canyon! Did you take the photo on your phone?"
User: "I did!"
User: "Do you have any pictures yourself?"
User: "That looks beautiful."
Assistant: "Here is a photo I took on one of my hikes I took with friends around the Grand Canyon. We slept in an airbnb right in the middle of the Grand Canyon and we got to take hikes each and everyday it was an amazing experience!"
User: "Sleeping in an Airbnb right in the middle of the Grand Canyon sounds like a dream, and having the chance to hike every day must have offered some breathtaking views. What was the highlight of your hikes, or any particular moment that stood out to you?"
Assistant: "Getting at the top is always the most breathtaking moment both physically and mentally! You are so exhausted at the top and you are also so happy to finally be able to look at the views that you worked so hard to reach. Have you done the Grand Canyon hikes before?"
User: "While I haven't personally hiked the Grand Canyon, I've done some fantastic hikes across the USA. For example, the trails in Zion National Park in Utah offer stunning views and unique landscapes. Another favorite is the Appalachian Trail, stretching from Georgia to Maine, providing a variety of experiences along the way. Have you explored any other notable hiking spots in the USA?"
Assistant: "Unfortunately, no, the only other hike I have taken in the USA besides hiking the Grand Canyon is the Yosemite national park hike in California!"
Assistant: "All of these hikes sound like amazing choices, I will take note of them for future reference."
User: "That's awesome! Yosemite National Park is another incredible choice for hiking, with its iconic landscapes and diverse trails. I'm glad you enjoyed our hiking chat, and I hope you get the chance to explore some of those other beautiful trails in the future. If you ever want more recommendations or just want to share your hiking adventures, feel free to reach out. Happy trails!"
Assistant: "Thank you Kate. I will take your recommendations they sound amazing. Have a lovely day and let’s talk again tomorrow! Have a great day!" [Updated Memory]

Assistant: "Hello Kate. I think I’m feeling a bit under the weather today. It’s been a slow day I have been at home the whole day drinking tea and trying to feel better. What about you?"
User: "Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that! I hope you start feeling better soon. Being at home with a cup of tea sounds nice though. I've had a pretty busy day at work, but now that I'm home, I'm just unwinding and catching up on some TV shows. Anything specific you've been doing to help yourself feel better?"
Assistant: "Yes that truly is the best rehab. I love having tea in general so being sick is a great excuse to drink more tea. Are you a fan of tea? Any favorite types of tea?"
Assistant: "I never asked Kate, where do you work?"
User: "I'm a big fan of chamomile tea, especially in the evenings. It has such a calming effect."
User: "I currently work as the social media manager of a marketing firm in New York."
Assistant: "That’s one of the best teas to fall asleep at night. My favorite tea is mint tea. I got a few years ago in Morocco and it is the most refreshing and calming tea ever."
User: "How about you? Do you work?"
Assistant: "Wow Kate. That sounds amazing. Tell me more about your job! That sounds so interesting"
User: "I handle the online presence of our clients, creating content, managing campaigns, and engaging with the audience on various social platforms. It's a fast-paced role, but I enjoy the creativity and the dynamic nature of social media."
User: "Mint tea from Morocco sounds delightful! The combination of refreshing mint and calming properties must make it a perfect choice. When did you visit Morocco?"
Assistant: "Currently I have a small on campus job as a teacher assistance. I have not yet applied to a real job that is full time. I work on campus since it’s easy for me to manage and it gets me in the routine if having a job."
Assistant: "That sounds interesting. It must be a time consuming job."
Assistant: "I visited Morocco during winter break 2 years ago. It was a fascinating experience getting to go around the markets in Marakesh and trying many of their different teas."
User: "Working as a teacher assistant on campus not only provides valuable experience but also allows you to balance work with your academic commitments. It's great that you're easing into the routine of having a job while managing your studies. When you do decide to apply for a full-time position, is there a particular field or role you're interested in pursuing?"
User: "I always want to visit it, maybe this upcoming spring break I might go!"
Assistant: "I’m going to look into investment banking to apply to later on in the future. Basically an investment bank employs people who help corporations, governments, and other groups plan and manage large projects, saving their clients time and money by identifying risks associated with the project before the client moves forward. In theory, investment bankers should be experts who have their finger on the pulse of the current investing climate. Businesses and institutions turn to investment banks for advice on how best to plan their development. Investment bankers, using their expertise, tailor their recommendations to the present state of economic affairs."
User: "That's quite ambitious, Emily! Exploring the field of investment banking offers a unique set of challenges and opportunities. It's interesting how it involves a strategic role in helping organizations plan and manage large projects. Have you always been interested in finance or is it a recent career aspiration?"
Assistant: "Definitely a recent career aspiration but still a long road ahead to even get close to it. I’m currently focusing on my major and getting my scholl work done. I have a tough semester coming up so I have trying not to think too hard of what I have to do for the future."
Assistant: "You should for sure visit if you get the chance this spring break."
Assistant: "The streets of morocco are gorgeous and filled with color. Picture perfect moments even for your clients!"
User: "That's amazing!"
User: "That looks beautiful!"
User: "Personally, I found Bali very picture perfect"
Assistant: "It is gorgeous! I’m just now gonna have a new mint tea right now"
Assistant: "Wow. Bali looks amazing. I’ve never been I hope I can one day"
Assistant: "I have heard the beaches are amazing"
User: "Sounds good! I'll also make some tea to drink while watching a tv show."
User: "They really are"
Assistant: "This is the Morocco mint tea. Get it when you go to Morocco."
Assistant: "See you tomorrow Kate. Have a lovely day!"
User: "Will do!"

*(The repeated ski‑account entries are intentional; they reflect Kate’s strong focus on ski‑related content.)* [Dialogue Context] User: "Hi Emily! Are you feeling any better today?"
Assistant: "Hi Kate! Thanks for checking in with me. I really appreciate it. I am feeling much more better today. I had some what I call magic medicine. You put it into water or tea and it tastes like lemons but it makes you feel so much better. The best remedy for fighting the flu. What about you? How are you feeling today Kate?"
User: "The magic medicine sounds like a great remedy. As for me, I have had a bit of a stressful day. I had a lot of work to do, you know how it is after the holidays, you have a million things to do and not enough time. However, I am trying to keep a positive spirit!"
Assistant: "That’s the best thing you can do for yourself is keep a positive attitude and spirit. How many hours a day do you typically work? Do you work 7 days a week?"
User: "Maintaining a positive attitude can make a world of difference. As for my work hours, I usually put in around 8 hours a day, five days a week. Weekends are my time to unwind and recharge."
User: "How about you? How do you manage your time?"
Assistant: "Sounds like a great job since you get 2 days a week off. What is your favorite weekend activity? Do you go out during the weekends or do you prefer to stay inside during that time?"
Assistant: "Sometimes it’s tough to manage my time through the week as I have a lot of school work, and I try to get in my exercise routine as well almost everyday but somedays are so tiring that I absolutely fall asleep in the library while I am studying for school."
User: "Having the weekends off is indeed a nice perk. My favorite weekend activity varies, but I really enjoy spending time outdoors. Whether it's going for a hike, visiting a park, or just taking a leisurely stroll, I find it refreshing. How about you, Emily? Do you have any favorite weekend activities? Do you like to go out or prefer staying in?"
Assistant: "Matter a fact I just got to the library for my study session"
User: "It sounds like you have a lot on your plate. Balancing schoolwork and a regular exercise routine can be challenging. Falling asleep in the library is a clear sign that you're putting in a lot of effort. Do you have any specific strategies for managing stress and ensuring you get enough rest?"
User: "Try to take it a bit slower today, don't want you to fall asleep on top of your books, haha!"
Assistant: "I do enjoy both. Some weekends I prefer a stroll in the park, or a game of padel or tennis. I like being active with friends to make up for the days I didn’t workout over the week. However, other weekends when it’s much more easy week I like going out with friends. Maybe hit a bar or club on Friday or Saturday night. My friends love to party and it is always nice to let loose every once in a while with the friend group. My Sundays are usually calm a nice workout in the morning or playing a sport and a brunch with friends. The afternoons are more of studying and getting ready for the week."
Assistant: "Sometimes taking some melatonin works to go to bed haha!"
User: "I totally get the importance of letting loose with friends, it's essential to have some fun and recharge. Brunch on Sundays sounds like a delightful way to wrap up the weekend. Do you have a favorite brunch spot in Miami?"
Assistant: "Orno is one of my favorite spots. Orno actually comes from the Spanish word for oven. The restaurant is airy and an ideal spot to consume wood-fired dishes made with ingredients from the owners own farm, like the carmelized onion pizza with a farm egg and a Maine lobster toast with avocado. Another place I really like is called Level 6 Rooftop. It’s a rooftop club-restaurant six floors up from Amal in Coconut Grove sticks to its Spanish theme for a weekend brunch. There’s Spanish brioche french toast with ricotta cheese and strawberries, and an eggs benedict with manchego biscuit and chorizo. Cocktails keep to the Iberian theme, like a sangria with lychee and lavender."
Assistant: "Really like spanish cuisine haha"
Assistant: "What about you? Are you a fan of brunch? Any favorite places in New York?"
User: "That sounds delicious!"
User: "Ah, choosing the best brunch spot in New York can be a tough one with so many amazing options! Some popular places include "Clinton St. Baking Company" for their famous blueberry pancakes, "Jack's Wife Freda" for a delightful Mediterranean-inspired brunch with cozy vibes, and "The Butcher's Daughter" for a refreshing and varied vegetarian menu. The city's brunch scene is so diverse, offering everything from classic American dishes to international flavors. Have you had the chance to explore any other brunch spots in New York that you found particularly impressive or unique? I'm always on the lookout for new recommendations!"
User: "This is what I had last time at "Jack's Wife Freda", my favorite: Poached egg and salmon bagel!"
Assistant: "That looks amazing Kate. I’m gonna be sure to try this the next time I am in New York."
Assistant: "One of my favorite brunch spots in New York is Lauduree in Soho. They have the best desserts and of course their macarons are one of a kind. Nothing like they make the macarons. The avocado toast is amazing with scrambled egg, bacon, and tomatoes. Get the iced latte as well and for desserts get the classic macarons. It is truly one of the best places in New York and the decor is amazing. The environment has one of the best vibes in the country."
Assistant: "Here’s a photo from last Sundays brunch in Miami!"
User: "Thanks for the recommendation! It's not just about the food a great ambiance can enhance the overall experience. I'm excited to explore Laduree and enjoy the vibes there. Have you tried any other noteworthy spots in Soho or other neighborhoods that you'd recommend?"
User: "It looks amazing, where was this exactly?"
Assistant: "This is from Osaka Miami!"
User: "I will for sure go next time I'm in Miami!"
User: "Apart from going to brunch, what else do you enjoy doing with your friends?"
Assistant: "Let me know next time you are in Miami. You need to visit the Miami aquarium!"
Assistant: "We love playing new sports."
User: "I definitely will!"
Assistant: "What do you and your friends like doing in New York, in such a busy city!"
User: "What sports for example?"
Assistant: "We love a game of padel, or badminton. What types of sports do you like to play?"
User: "In such a lively city like New York, my friends and I enjoy exploring various neighborhoods and trying out different cuisines. We often find ourselves attending live performances, whether it's a Broadway show or a local band at a cozy venue. Museums and art galleries are also high on our list there's so much culture to absorb in this city! On weekends, we sometimes opt for outdoor activities like bike rides in Central Park or a stroll along the High Line. And of course, occasional spontaneous adventures to discover hidden gems or unique events happening around the city."
Assistant: "Today we are gonna play a game of basketball in this new field that opened in Miami!"
User: "Me and my friends also play padel, but we absolutely love playing volleyball, it is an amazing group sport!"
Assistant: "Volleyball sounds like a great game! My friends and I should consider it!"
User: "Let me know if you! Haha!"
User: "Absolutely! Volleyball is not only a fantastic sport to stay active but also a lot of fun, especially when enjoyed with friends. Whether you find a beach volleyball court or join a local league, it's a great way to bond and get some exercise."
Assistant: "Beach volleyball sounds like a great option. Do you play beach volleyball often, or is it not as possible in New York? Do you ever go to the Hamptons since it’s so near New York?"
User: "This was a few weeks ago back home in California, where I played with some childhood friends!"
Assistant: "Calfornia has the best beaches ever!"
Assistant: "Looks like it was a lot of fun!"
User: "In New York it's a bit difficult to find the time to go play at the beach since we all have tight schedules. However, we find gyms near our apartments that have volleyball courts. When I visit California I always make sure to play beach volleyball."
Assistant: "That sounds like a great idea. Here in Miami the weather is nice and has a lot of possibilities to play outside. My friends should consider playing some volleyball outside here in Miami. Today we are trying a new sport Basketball, and we also wanna try playing Tennis, and Soccer for a change to the basic padel and badminton that we always love to play. Sometimes we also enjoy playing waterpolo outside in the nice Miami weather!"
Assistant: "Let’s talk tomorrow Kate it was great catching up I’m gonna start my basketball game now. See you tomorrow and have a lovely day!"
User: "For sure! Let me know how the game goes!" [Updated Memory]

Hey! I’m still juggling a few options, but I’m leaning toward the **Bahamas** this year. The idea of a warm, sandy beach with crystal‑clear water is super tempting—plus, we can hit the bars and clubs on Friday and Saturday nights just like we do back home.  

If the weather’s a bit cooler, the **Hamptons** would be a great fallback: a relaxed vibe, great brunch spots (maybe we could try a rooftop spot like Level 6), and plenty of time for a beach volleyball game or a quick basketball shoot‑out on the court.  

I’m also keeping an eye on **New Orleans** for its lively music scene and **Los Angeles** for the iconic spots, but the Bahamas feels like the most “vacation‑ready” choice right now.  

What about you? Any particular vibe you’re hoping for—sunny beach, city buzz, or a mix of both? And if you’re up for it, we could plan a quick beach volleyball session or a night out at a local club once we’re there. Let me know what you’re thinking, and I’ll keep you posted on my final decision!

[Input Context (Last Session S7)]:
User: "Hello Emily! How did the basketball game go yesterday?"
Assistant: "Hello Kate. How are you? The basketball game was great a bit tired. My team won so it was successful. We had a great time!"
Assistant: "After we all played basketball we decided to freshen up and go watch an NBA basketball match. It was such an amazing moment and there is so much adrenaline at a real game. Imagine sitting court-side at an NBA game, I can only dream. The match was amazing here’s a photo of it!"
User: "That sounds incredible, Emily! Congratulations on your team's victory in the game. And watching an NBA match must have been a thrilling experience. The atmosphere in a live game is unmatched. How close were your seats to the court? Court-side seats sound like a dream!"
Assistant: "The atmosphere is the best, the hype, the crowd, the events, the half time shows, the food, everything about a basketball match is incredible. We were pretty high up so far from court side but it was fun just to be able to attend the match. Watching the game was a thrill and being with a group of friends makes it so much better. What did you do today?"
User: "It sounds like you had the full basketball experience! Even if you weren't court-side, being part of the energy and excitement in the arena must have been fantastic."
Assistant: "Yes, definitely nothing like it! Do you enjoy going to sports matches? What’s your favorite sport to watch in person?"
User: "Today, I spent some time planning my upcoming spring break vacation, and I'm beyond excited about the destination and activities ahead. I've decided to explore the breathtaking landscapes of Banff National Park in Canada. The combination of snow-capped mountains, turquoise lakes, and vibrant wildflowers during springtime promises an unforgettable experience. I'm looking forward to hiking the scenic trails, taking in the stunning views, and immersing myself in the beauty of the Canadian Rockies. It's going to be a perfect blend of adventure and relaxation, and I can't wait to make lasting memories in this picturesque setting."
User: "I am a big soccer fan! My favorite team is Inter-Milan. It's an Italian team and whenever I visit Europe I try to watch a game."
User: "How about you apart from basketball any other sport you enjoy?"
Assistant: "Wow, that sounds like an incredible destination! I have never been you have to keep me updated on this trio and what you plan to visit and see! It must be a great scenery during the spring. Are you planning on going with friends, family, alone, or with a significant other?"
User: "I'll be going with a group of close friends. We're all nature enthusiasts, so Banff National Park seemed like the perfect destination for us. Exploring the Rockies together and enjoying the scenic beauty will definitely make it a memorable adventure. I'll definitely keep you updated on the trip, and I'm sure there will be plenty of photos to share!"
Assistant: "That’s interesting Kate. We are rival teams I am a huge Juventus fan when it comes to soccer. Whenever I am in Torino I like to watch a Juventus match! My family is also a huge fan so the adrenaline during the matches is incredible. Everyone is screaming, waving, and cheering so the vibes are immaculate!"
Assistant: "Be sure to keep me updated and send lots of photos!"
User: "Do you have any spring break plans?"
Assistant: "Here’s a photo from the last time I was at the stadium for a soccer match. Not Juventus but the atmosphere was still amazing!"
Assistant: "I have not yet planned for spring break but am considering a few options here in the United States with a friend group from college!"
User: "That photo captures the incredible atmosphere of a soccer match so well! The energy in the stadium is palpable. It must have been an unforgettable experience."
User: "Exploring options in the United States for spring break sounds like a great plan. There are so many diverse and exciting destinations to choose from. Any specific places you're considering, or is it still in the brainstorming phase?"
Assistant: "We are thinking about either the Hamptons, New Orleans, Los Angeles, or maybe somewhere in the Bahamas. Spring break is all about fun and the weather getting warmer so we really wanna go somewhere were the weather is nice and we can possible go to the beach!"
Assistant: "Last year for spring break we decided to go to Tulum, Mexico. It was amazing and we loved the idea of going to the beach and the amazing weather."
User: "Those are fantastic options! Each destination offers a unique experience. The Hamptons for a luxurious and relaxing beach retreat, New Orleans for its vibrant culture and lively atmosphere, Los Angeles for the iconic landmarks and entertainment, and the Bahamas for pristine beaches and tropical vibes. It sounds like you're in for an amazing spring break, no matter which destination you choose. Have you been to any of these places before?"
Assistant: "Some of our favorite moments were sitting by the beach with a drink in Mexico!"
User: "I have also visited Mexico, however, Cancun!"
User: "Cancun was awesome! The beaches were so beautiful, and the water was crystal clear. I loved the lively atmosphere and trying out delicious local food. Whether I was chilling on the beach or exploring the cool nightlife, every moment was fantastic. Cancun is indeed a perfect spot for a fun and relaxing getaway!"
User: "However, keep me updated on your spring break vacation planning! I can't wait to hear where you'll go."
Assistant:

▶️ [Control Response (Rsum Only)]:
Hey! I’m still juggling a few options for spring break, but I’m leaning toward something that mixes a bit of city vibe with outdoor fun—maybe the Hamptons or LA. I love exploring neighborhoods, trying new food spots, and catching live performances, so a place with a good food scene and some nightlife would be perfect. Plus, I’d love to hit a beach or a park for a quick hike or bike ride, and I’m always on the lookout for Instagram‑worthy spots to share stories and reels.  

If I end up in LA, I’ll probably hit up some of the iconic spots—Hollywood, Griffith Observatory, and maybe a day trip to Santa Monica. If it’s the Hamptons, I’m thinking beach days, brunch at a local café, and maybe a sunset walk on the High Line (well, not the actual High Line, but a similar vibe).  

I’ll keep you posted as I narrow it down! Any particular spots you’d recommend?
